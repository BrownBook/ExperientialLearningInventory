# Experiential Learning Inventory

Experiential Learning Inventory is a sleek, intunitive, and powerful web-application for tracking and approving student experiential learning activities and out-of-state learning placements in a higher-education setting. It is created and maintained by [Brown Book Software](https://www.brownbooksoftware.com/) (and other contributers).

## Purpose

Experiential Learning Inventory helps a Univeristy track internships, practica, clinicals, field work, independent study, and other experiential learning activities campus-wide. We specifically care about:

- Where each student is located during their internship (because of [State Authorization](http://wcet.wiche.edu/focus-areas/policy-and-regulation/state-authorization) and in case of emergency)
- Who we should contact in case of emergency
- Generating and storing a valid contract for each internship, to protect all parties (Student, Hosts, and the University) in case of legal dispute.

We've realized other benefits too:

- We have great data for reporting and data mining!
- Internships tend to get approved more quickly, or we have good notes on what happened otherwise.
- Fewer students and faculty members skip steps in the approval process. We catch errors before they become problems.
- Cut costs by streamlining the approval process (less person-hours) and saving paper.
